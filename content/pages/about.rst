This page is a journal on solutions I came across - professional and personal
which I found interesting and others that I came up on my own.


Since everything is a work in progress and we can only evolve based on previous
achievements, I hope this can help others to solve the same problems I once had
and allow others to go to the next step, the same way this helped me

About myself
============

I'm above all curious person trying to figure some solutions on the daily
problems, but I'm also a IT professional and sometimes the daily problems
and the professional challenges overlap, so I found useful to have this
kind of blog around.

Enjoy.

This page is a journal on solutions I came across - professional and personal
which I found interesting and others that I came up on my own.


Since everything is a work in progress and we can only evolve based on previous
achievements, I hope this can help others to solve the same problems I once had
and allow others to go to the next step, the same way this helped me


Why
===

Across the years I've been looking for information to do my work.

The source could be some forum, some blog, some personal page hosted on an
university... These pages for some reason aren't maintained anymore so they
got lost forever.
The authors eventually forgot they wrote that, or moved the content to another
place to be found.

This is blog is where I keep a personal log of things I've been doing and also
an homage to some articles that I consider relevant to keep.


About myself
============

I'm above all curious person trying to figure some solutions on the daily
problems, but I'm also a IT professional and sometimes the daily problems
and the professional challenges overlap, so I found useful to have this
kind of blog around.

Enjoy.

Cool, another boring page on GPG. The internet need this.

This topic divides people between genuine security freaks and those who simply
like the simple things in life and hope that the plans will always get together.


This article it's intended to be for both. I'm trying to cover the best key
setup, the purpose of keys and why keys can be really important today.

I've also added some drama with gihub horror story and practical examples such
as `passwordstore` and gnome-keymanager.
